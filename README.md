# Pico-8 Hero Breakout

So I'm working through the Lazy Game Devs Academy "Pico-8 Tutorial - Breakout", as a means to learn more about programming the Pico-8.  What I'm also going to try and do here is actually create a snapshot of the code as it stands after each lesson so others can look for it and maybe check their work.

I'm going to try and preserve the code exactly as it appears at the end of each lesson, minor bugs and all.  Again, the point is to provide others with a means of checking their work or a faster/easier way to review the code for each lesson.
